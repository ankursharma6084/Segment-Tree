CSES Problem Max Range query and update in segment tree

```

Given an array of n integers, your task is to process q queries of the following types:
update the value at position k to u
what is the sum of values in range [a,b]?
Input

The first input line has two integers n and q: the number of values and queries.

The second line has n integers x1,x2,…,xn: the array values.

Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. Each line has three integers: either "1 k u" or "2 a b".

Output

Print the result of each query of type 2.

Constraints
1≤n,q≤2⋅105
1≤xi,u≤109
1≤k≤n
1≤a≤b≤n
